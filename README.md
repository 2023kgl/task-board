# Task Board

## Description

This task board was created with intentions of using to keep track of tasks that need to be done within a deadline/due date.
This task board will come in handy for when there are too many things that need to be done and will help complete by the DUE DATE/DEADLINE. This is important in many aspects of life so this will be very helpful to anyone. 
I have learn how to create something so simple to the user but I found it very challenging to create behind the scenes. I have learned A LOT about back-end development and have much more to learn. I hope this makes any user's life more organized and easier by keeping track of all kinds of tasks.

## Credits

I attend office hours before and after class every day of class. 
Class TA's assisted me by answering my questions. I used ChatGPT to obtain a better understanding of certain functions. I used Google and YouTube as well. The mini-challenge was also of great use.
